# Zoohackathon 2016The National Zoo held its first ever Zoohackathon across multiple continents and countries during the weekend of October 7 - October 9. We have built a discrete reporting tool for wildlife trafficking and deforestation. The reporting tool consists of a backend written in Python and Flask (see the `web` folder), and frontend smartwatch applications written for Android Wear (see `android` folder) and Apple Watch (see `ios` folder).# Participants* [Kunal Sarkhel](https://github.com/techwizrd)* George Contreras* Vikram Sarkhel* Adal Santana* Zack Alfakir* Jay Kim# LicenseThis entire project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
